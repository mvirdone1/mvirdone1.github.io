	Results[2] = "The teammate brings some focus from the greater issue, to the part which they can personally solve and the discussion continues. <br> <br> When asking these questions, avoid 'why did you' and instead focus on 'what did you want to accomplish' it avoids the negative reaction to 'why'";

	// Lazy
	Buttons[4] = "Seeing the teammate reach a point where they cannot solve their problem, you use the 'lazy question' and ask 'how can I help'?";
	Results[4] = "The employee immediately wants you to solve their problem, but you realize that jumping into the 'rescuer' role in the Karpman Drama Triangle (Victim, Persecutor, Rescuer), and instead you re-focus the discussion around helping the employee solve their own problem'";
	
	// Strategic
	Buttons[5] = "As the employee identifies their possible courses of action, it seems like the solution to their problem is going to add more work to their over-burdened work load. You ask 'if you say yes to this, what are you saying no to?'";
	Results[5] = "The teammate reconsiders the opportunity cost of taking on any assignments and looks at it through a lens of maximizing the work which is important. <br><br> You briefly discuss the five strategic questions <ol><li>What is our winning aspiration</li><li>Where will we play (focus)</li><li>How will we win</li><li>What capabilities do we need</li><li>What systems are required </li></ol>";
	
	// Learning
